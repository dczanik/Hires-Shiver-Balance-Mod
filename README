This mod of the Ur-Quan Masters aims to combine the Improved Netmelee Mod [1] and the HD Mod [2], allowing fun, balanced network play with dczanik's wonderful graphics.

To run this mod, you will need the base content and hires packages from the HD mod. As of this writing you will need to extract them from an HD mod source tree, which
you can get here: http://code.google.com/p/uqm-hd/source/checkout

For discussion on the development of this mod, it is currently suggested that you try and get in touch with the collaborators in #uqm-arena on Freenode [3].
